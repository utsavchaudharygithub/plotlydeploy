 We created website for Roza to her volunteers to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

Our company used JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a Bar chart, Bubble chart,  Gauge chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.
